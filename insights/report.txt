# Cement Strength Prediction Model – Project Report

## 1. Problem Definition

Concrete compressive strength is a fundamental property that determines the performance, safety, and durability of concrete structures. Traditionally, determining compressive strength requires laboratory testing, which is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and costly. With increasing demand for efficient construction practices, there is a need for predictive models that can estimate concrete strength accurately using mixture proportions and curing age.

The problem addressed in this project is to **predict the compressive strength of concrete** based on its constituent materials and age using machine learning techniques. This is formulated as a **supervised regression problem**, where the input variables are concrete mix parameters and the output variable is the compressive strength.

## 2. Dataset Information

The dataset used for this project is the **Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset**, which contains experimental data collected from various concrete mix designs.

### Input Features:

* Cement: Amount of cement in kg/m³
* Slag: Blast furnace slag content in kg/m³
* Ash: Fly ash content in kg/m³
* Water: Water content in kg/m³
* Superplastic: Superplasticizer content in kg/m³
* CoarseAgg: Coarse aggregate in kg/m³
* FineAgg: Fine aggregate in kg/m³
* Age: Curing age of concrete in days

### Target Variable:

* Strength: Concrete compressive strength measured in MPa

### Engineered Features:

To enhance model performance, additional domain-specific features were derived:

* Water–Cement Ratio
* Total Binder Content
* Aggregate-to-Cement Ratio
* Cement–Water Interaction Term
* Age–Strength Proxy

The dataset consists entirely of numerical variables, making it suitable for regression-based machine learning models.

## 3. Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the **Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset**, which contains numerical features representing the composition of concrete mixtures and curing age.

### Features:

* Cement (kg/m³)
* Blast Furnace Slag (kg/m³)
* Fly Ash (kg/m³)
* Water (kg/m³)
* Superplasticizer (kg/m³)

## 4. Project Architecture (Modular Approach)

The project is implemented using a **modular architecture**, where each major step in the ML lifecycle is handled by a separate Python module. This improves readability, maintainability, debugging, and scalability.
